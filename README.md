# Home Finder
Find your next perfect home!

## Project Intro
The goal of this application is to query a number of APIs in order to find information about a specific area in the UK that might be useful to somebody who may be considering moving home to that area. This information is then appropriately summarised and presented to the user both visually and as text.

The APIs utilised in this project are as follows:
* [Postcode & Geolocation API for the UK](https://postcodes.io/)
* [Police data API](https://data.police.uk/docs/)
* [QuickChart API](https://quickchart.io/)
* [Transport for London API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/)

## Learning Outcomes
This is the second project of Founders and Coders' Skills Bootcamp Cohort 27. The goal of the project <br />
is fulfilling the learning outcomes below:

### JavaScript
- [x] Write code that executes asynchronously
- [x] Use callbacks to access values that aren’t available synchronously
- [x] Use promises to access values that aren’t available synchronously
- [x] Use the fetch method to make HTTP requests and receive responses
- [x] Configure the options argument of the fetch method to make GET and POST requests
- [x] Use the map array method to create a new array containing new values

### DOM
- [x] Access DOM nodes using a variety of selectors
- [x] Add and remove DOM nodes to change the content on the page
- [x] Toggle the classes applied to DOM nodes to change their CSS properties

### Design
- [x] Use consistent layout and spacing
- [x] Follow a spacing guideline to give our app a consistent feel

### Developer Toolkit
- [x] Debug client side JS in our web browser
- [x] Use console.log() to help us debug our code
