# Home Finder
Find your next perfect home!

## Project Intro
The goal of this application is to query two APIs, the UK Postcode API and the Police API, to get information about a specific postcode.<br />
It then gathers crime statistics in that neighbourhood and displays it in a user-friendly manner, allowing the user <br />
the ability to analyze data and make an informed decsision. They can also search, filter or sort the data that is being displayed.<br />

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- [UK Postcode API](https://postcodes.io/)
- [Police API](https://data.police.uk/docs/)

## How to Run it Locally
- Clone the repository by running this command on your terminal
  ``` terminal
  git clone https://github.com/fac27/home-finder
  ```
- Open the cloned repository in your preferred code editor and run Liveserver
  - You can also run the Index.html file through your browser if needed

## User Stories
- [ ] See an interesting mashup of different data
- [ ] Input information to change the displayed result
- [ ] View the app on all of my devices
- [ ] Display some kind of indication that the data is loading
- [ ] Display clear messages if something goes wrong

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Query at least two APIs using fetch
- [ ] Dynamic content generated with JS
- [ ] A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme
- [ ] A responsive, mobile-first design
- [ ] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible

## Learning Outcomes
This is the second project of Founders and Coders' Skills Bootcamp Cohort 27. The goal of the project <br />
is fulfilling the learning outcomes below:

### JavaScript
- [ ] Write code that executes asynchronously
- [ ] Use callbacks to access values that aren’t available synchronously
- [ ] Use promises to access values that aren’t available synchronously
- [ ] Use the fetch method to make HTTP requests and receive responses
- [ ] Configure the options argument of the fetch method to make GET and POST requests
- [ ] Use the map array method to create a new array containing new values
- [ ] Use the filter array method to create a new array with certain values removed

### DOM
- [ ] Access DOM nodes using a variety of selectors
- [ ] Add and remove DOM nodes to change the content on the page
- [ ] Toggle the classes applied to DOM nodes to change their CSS properties

### Design
- [ ] Use consistent layout and spacing
- [ ] Follow a spacing guideline to give our app a consistent feel

### Developer Toolkit
- [ ] Debug client side JS in our web browser
- [ ] Use console.log() to help us debug our code
